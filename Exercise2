Letâ€™s write a program that displays train times for one of two trains. Here is the raw data for the timetable:

New York - > Boston
New York: 12:02
New Haven: 13:50
Providence: 15:13
Boston: 16:36
 

New York -> Chicago
New York: 8:19
Albany: 11:40
Buffalo: 17:21
Cleveland: 21:12
Toledo: 23:18
Chicago: 5: 28
 
Our program will ask the user which train they want. then display the time table for that train. We will use an iterator to output the timetable one row at a time.
 
1. Create a two element array, where each element is a hash.
 
2. Give each hash a key / value pair for specifying each train route.
 
3. Give each hash another key/value pair to hold the schedule. "schedule" should be the key; the value will be another hash.
 
4. The innermost hashes should consist of key value pairs, with each city as a key, and the time as a value (as strings).
 
5. Prompt the user to choose which schedule they want. Be sure to list their choices for them.
 
6. Collect the user's response and display a table for them.
 
7. Put it altogether and test the program.

        },
         {"route" => "New York -> Chicago", "schedule" =>

         }

         puts "#{index+1}: #{train["route"]}"
