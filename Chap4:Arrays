Lets begin with Array's

so array can be defines as follows

arra1=[]
arra2=[1,2,3,4]

Any operation on array can get value in the index for eg:

print array2[3] or puts arra2[3]
output = 4


it has 2 main function:
-- push
-- <<

push:
----

arra2.push("hello")

answer

[1,2,3,4,"hello"]

<<
---

arra2 << "yello"
[1,2,3,4,"hello","yello"]
