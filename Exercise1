Lets create a sample program that will print out either

1, 2, 3 
or 

one, two, three
1) Create a file called counting.rb

2) Inside the file define an array consisting of the numbers 1 - 3.

3) define another array consisting of the numbers written out as strings.

4) Instruct the user to type in either 1 or one.

5) Use gets to get the user input. (Hint: call .strip! on your user input string to remove the new line, \n character)

6) If the user typed 1, output the three elements of the first array. If the user typed one, then output the elements of the second array.

7) Run your program to test it.





answer:
#!/home/clen.mo/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.1/bin/ruby

a=[1, 2, 3]
a1=["one","two","three"]



puts "Please type in either one or 1"

b=gets.strip

if b == "1"
	print a[1]
else
	print a1[1]
end
